## Description

* This repository contains the MATLAB code for numerical experiments presented in the paper "*A modified proximal point algorithm for solving a generalized low-tubal-rank tensor approximation problem based on the t-product*".  
* This paper proposes the generalized low-tubal-rank tensor approximation (GLTRTA) problem, which extends the generalized low-rank matrix approximation problem from matrices to third-order tensors using the $t$-product, where the $t$-product  is a specific type of tensor multiplication. The GLTRTA problem is introduced as an extension of the existing low-tubal-rank tensor problem. We also develop a novel iterative algorithm, the PGS method, to estimate a solution for the GLTRTA problem. The PGS method is based on a proximal point modification of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. It is demonstrated that the limit points of the converging sequence generated by the PGS method are critical points of the objective function. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the PGS method, including its application to  color image denoising.
